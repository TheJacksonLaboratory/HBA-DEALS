Title: Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis of Differential Expression and ALternative SPlicing (HBA-DEALS)
Version: 0.99.0
Author: Guy Karlebach and Peter N Robinson
Maintainer: Guy karlebach <karleg@jax.org>
Description: HBA-DEALS takes as input a matrix where the first column gives the gene name, the second the
              transcript name and the rest of the columns are transcriopt counts, and predict the probbability
              of differntial expression for each gene and differential transcript proportion for each transcript.
